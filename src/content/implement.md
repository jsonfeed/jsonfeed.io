title: "Implement JSON Feed Into Your Website"
---

Software used to create websites such as Content Management Systems (CMSs) and Static Site Generators (SSGs) sometimes have support for JSON Feed built right in or have plugin supports.
Here's what we know about so far:


## CMSs

### Drupal

- [JSON Feed](https://www.drupal.org/project/json_feed) by Karl Shea.

### WordPress

- [jsonfeed-wp](https://github.com/manton/jsonfeed-wp) by Manton Reece - a WordPress plugin that gives your website a dynamic JSON Feed.
This plugin is created by one of the co-founders of JSON Feed.


## SSGs

### Gotham

- [Gotham](https://www.gothamhq.com) - Gotham has built in support for JSON Feed.
Just building your site with Gotham will generate feeds.
